    <p>Venus, formerly known as Zohra, is the second planet in the Solar System. It completes its orbit around the Sun in 224.7 Earth days. It has the longest orbital period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System, and rotates in the opposite direction to the other planets. Venus has no natural satellites. Its name comes from Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Venus is the second brightest natural celestial body in the night sky after the Moon, and with a magnitude of −4.6, it is bright enough to cast a shadow, and is rarely visible to the naked eye on clear days. Venus, which orbits within the Earth's orbit, is an inner planet and never gets very far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun is 47.8°.

        Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's sister planet. This is because of their similar size, mass, composition, and proximity to the Sun. On the other hand, it differs significantly from Earth. Venus has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of 96% carbon dioxide. The planet's atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth. This figure corresponds to the pressure of water at a depth of 900 m on Earth. Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System. With a surface temperature of 462 °C, it is even hotter than Mercury, which is closer to the Sun. Venus is covered with a dense layer of sulfuric acid clouds, which prevents direct visibility of the surface. It is believed that the planet once had oceans of water, but due to the greenhouse effect, the water gradually evaporated. It is believed that the water underwent photolysis, and due to the lack of a magnetic field on the planet, free hydrogen was dispersed into interplanetary space by the solar wind. The surface of Venus is a dry desert covered with plate-like rocks, and its surface is constantly renewed by erupting volcanoes.</p>
