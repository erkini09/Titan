    <p>Earth is the third planet in the Solar System from the Sun and the only celestial body on which life has been discovered. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, the Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. The Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in the universe, especially the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, and the Sun. The Earth moves in its orbit around the Sun every 365 days. During this time, the Earth rotates on its axis 365 (366) times.

        The tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation in a fixed plane causes the Earth to experience seasons. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon causes ebbs and flows. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and heaviest of the four inner planets (the inner planets in order of distance from the Sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars).
        
        The Earth's outer layer (lithosphere) has been divided into several rigid tectonic plates that have been moving along the surface for millions of years. About 29% of the Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered by water, mostly the world's oceans, but also lakes, rivers, and other freshwater bodies that together make up the hydrosphere. Most of the Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the Arctic sea ice. The Earth is constantly active, with a solid, metallic core and a liquid outer core that create the Earth's magnetic field, as well as a mantle layer that moves tectonic plates.</p>
