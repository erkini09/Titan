        <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in the Solar System. Mercury, a terrestrial planet, is
            the planet that orbits the Sun the fastest, completing one orbit in 88 days. However, Mercury rotates very
            slowly on its axis. 1 Mercury day is equal to 116 Earth days. Mercury has no natural satellites. The planet
            is named after Mercury, the god of trade and news in Roman mythology.

            Mercury has a very thin atmosphere that is almost unable to retain heat. For this reason, sharp temperature
            differences occur on the planet's surface during the change of day and night. Although daytime temperatures
            near Mercury's equator can reach 427 °C, nighttime temperatures can drop to −173 °C. In Mercury's polar
            regions, temperatures are always below −93 °C. Mercury has the least inclination of the planets in the Solar
            System. However, its orbit is elliptical, and it has the most eccentric orbit of any planet in the Solar
            System. It does not orbit the Sun twice. The planet's orbit is expected to become more eccentric over time,
            with its eccentricity increasing from its current value of 0.21 to 0.5. Mercury's farthest distance from the
            Sun is about 1.5 times greater than its closest distance. Mercury's surface is heavily cratered, similar to
            the Moon in this respect. Its surface has been geologically inactive for billions of years.

            Mercury's rotation around the Sun is in a 3:2 resonance with its rotation around its axis, meaning that
            every three revolutions around the Sun are equivalent to twice its rotation on its axis. Therefore, an
            observer on Earth would see one day as the planet orbits the Sun twice.</p>
